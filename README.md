# Assignment-2-WildfirePrediction
#  Forest Fire Prediction Project

##  Introduction
This project aims to predict forest fire occurrence and severity using machine learning techniques. We use meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation to build predictive models.

##  Data and Features
- **Dataset**: Forest fire dataset with meteorological variables
- **Features Used**:
  - `Temperature`: Higher temperatures increase fire risk
  - `Humidity`: Lower humidity increases fire spread probability
  - `Wind Speed`: Stronger wind accelerates fire spread
  - `Rain`: Reduces fire risk
  - `Fire Occurrence`: Binary target variable indicating fire presence

##  Models Used
We implemented the following machine learning models:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **Stacking Model (Blending Multiple Models)**

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LW567-lab/ForestFireEDA.git
   cd ForestFireEDA
